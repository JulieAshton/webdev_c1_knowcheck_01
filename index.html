            <h2>What You Need to Know</h2>

            <p>I love to travel.  My most recent adventure took me to Spain for two glorious weeks.  If you haven't been, then I highly recommend it.  Barring the say in a hilltop castle, the most interesting portion of my trip to Spain ended up being the border crossing into Gibraltar...did you know that Gibraltar is a British territory?  You have to have to go through passport control and walk across an air strip in order to make your way into the British territory; that being said, it's very much worth the trip.  One highlight, other than being able to speak English for a couple of hours, was the trip up to the Ape's Den in the Nature Preserve.  They keep the Barbary Macaque population at exactly 250 because the ledgend says that if the Barbary Macaques were to disappear, then it would mark the end of the British rule in Gibraltar.  Clearly the Brits still rule Gibraltar, as the Barbary Macaques continue to be one of the main tourist attractions.  Just make sure you keep a bit of distance, as they're little theives. </p>
